## Knapsack Problem with Simulated Annealing

Implementation of Simulated Annealing for solving knapsack problem on Python 2.7

### Usage
You can run the algorithm with default parameters: init temp: 100, Steps (aka. Time)= 100 by running this command in your terminal:

    python2.7 knapsack_problem_solver.py

Or specify them on your own. To get a complete list of possible parameters run:

    python2.7 knapsack_problem_solver.py --help  
  
### Test data
The "Datasets" directory contains data for experiments. The main format of data files is as follows:

 - Comments
 - Number of items
 - Capacity of Knapsack
 - Weight Cost data
